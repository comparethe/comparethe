## Screenity

- 💰 Free (and open source)
- 🔗 https://screenity.io/en/

2025-01-04 Looks great. Unfortunately may be abandoned as amazing lead developer got a job at a startup and no major updates on github for 11m.

Have used and its excellent. Simple, clean etc. No cloud uploading though so you have DIY.

The big daddy. The one everyone knows about. Acquired by Atlassian in 2023 so who knows where this is going. (probably higher prices)
