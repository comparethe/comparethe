## Comments

> After testing all paid AI code editor, I found Windsurf to be the best option, especially for my Ruby on Rails projects. Here's why: When I need to fix a bug, like an issue with the payment system, Windsurf automatically searches through the entire codebase to find not only the relevant file but also all related dependent files. In contrast, Cursor requires you to manually specify the exact files or folders you want to work with, making the process less efficient.
