Compare AI chat like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude etc.

The best large scale systematic comparison is probably https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard

You can "play" with it and it'll send the prompt to a couple of LLMs for you to choose which one is a "better" answers. 

They have a leaderboard where they compute the LLMs ELO and other metrics.

With release of Gemini seen a lot of discussion of type "Is Gemini better/worse than ChatGPT". Also personally interested as i use both an a bit tedious to copy and paste prompts between and then compare.

My 2c so far is that i prefer Gemini often. There's something a bit richer about its responses.

Deciding the "best" of Bach's choral music is like picking a favorite star in the Milky Way – they're all brilliant and dazzling in their own way! However, I can guide you towards some of his most beloved and revered choral works, based on their popularity, emotional depth, and technical mastery:

**Large-scale choral pieces:**

* **St. Matthew Passion:** This monumental oratorio tells the story of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, featuring awe-inspiring choruses like "Kommt, ihr Töchter, helft mir klagen" and the heartbreaking "Erbarme dich, mein Gott."
* **St. John Passion:** Another powerful oratorio exploring Jesus' Passion, with highlights like the majestic "Christe, du Lamm Gottes" and the dramatic "O hilf, Christe, Gottes Sohn."
* **B Minor Mass:** One of the most significant sacred choral works ever written, encompassing the entire Ordinary of the Mass. Renowned for its expressive movements and intricate counterpoint, the "Gloria" and "Sanctus" are particularly captivating.
* **Magnificat in D Major:** A joyful and celebratory setting of the Virgin Mary's song of praise, with vibrant polyphony and uplifting choral passages.

**Smaller choral works:**

* **Motets:** Bach's six large-scale motets showcase his virtuosity in choral writing, ranging from the solemn introspection of "Jesu, meine Freude" to the playful energy of "Komm, Jesu, komm."
* **Cantatas:** With over 200 cantatas, there's a treasure trove to explore! Here are a few noteworthy ones:
    * **"Jauchzet, frohlocket, auf zu prangen" (Christmas Oratorio):** A festive opening chorus full of jubilation.
    * **"Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis" (Cantata No. 21):** A poignant expression of faith and resilience.
    * **"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" (Cantata No. 80):** A powerful hymn of steadfastness and trust in God.

**Choral melodies:**

* **Bach's chorales**, used both within larger works and as standalone hymns, are renowned for their simplicity and profound beauty. Try listening to a collection of chorales and exploring their subtle variations and emotional textures.

Ultimately, the best way to discover your own favorites is to delve into Bach's choral music yourself! Many recordings are available online or in libraries, so start exploring and let yourself be transported by the genius of his music.
