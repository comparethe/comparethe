### VoiceInk

URL: https://tryvoiceink.com/  

💰 $25 one-time  

Short description: VoiceInk replicates much of Superwhisper’s functionality for a one-time fee. It lets users transcribe locally using ASR models for full privacy and offline use, connect to cloud providers via API keys, process pre-recorded audio, and apply AI-driven formatting; the project is open source for transparency (beingpax.medium.com, 2024).

Assessment: Best choice for developers seeking customization and privacy with good value.


### Aqua Voice

URL: https://withaqua.com/  

💰 (not specified)  

Short description: Aqua Voice runs in the cloud and supports both macOS and Windows, allowing even older systems to handle dictation; its standout feature is displaying text in real time as you speak (beingpax.medium.com, 2024).

Assessment: Great for those who need cross-platform live transcription, though reliance on cloud processing may not suit offline workflows.


### Wispr Flow

URL: https://wisprflow.ai/  

💰 $15 / month (after free tier)  

Short description: Wispr Flow is a polished dictation app for macOS, Windows, and iPhone that requires no complex setup; it has a generous free tier of about 2 000 words per week but lacks custom prompting features and has some iOS limitations (beingpax.medium.com, 2024).

Assessment: Suitable for ease of use and cross-platform support, but less flexible for advanced customization.


### Willow Voice

URL: https://willowvoice.com/  

💰 $15 / month  

Short description: Willow Voice resembles Wispr Flow but omits the live-text display found in Aqua Voice; it is available only for macOS and follows the same subscription pricing as Wispr Flow (beingpax.medium.com, 2024).

Assessment: A straightforward macOS option for users who don’t need real-time transcription or cross-platform support.


### SpeechPulse

URL: https://speechpulse.com/  

💰 $159 one-time  

Short description: SpeechPulse provides local dictation on Windows and macOS with real-time processing and an auto-input mode; because it uses cross-platform frameworks the UI is less refined, and the bundle costs US$159 (beingpax.medium.com, 2024).

Assessment: Useful for those needing features like automatic input and local processing, but the high price and rougher interface may deter casual users.


### Whispering

URL: https://whispering.bradenwong.com/  

💰 Free  

Short description: Whispering is a free, open-source alternative running on Windows, macOS, and Linux; its cross-platform nature is appealing, but it offers fewer features and a less polished experience than commercial apps (beingpax.medium.com, 2024).

Assessment: Good for budget-conscious users who value open-source software and Linux support, though not as feature-rich as other options.
