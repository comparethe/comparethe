Similar to Cosmos.so Pinterest etc but halfway to a secondbrain. more of the archive for a secondbrain.

Would put in a category with:

- raindrop.io
- pinboard.in
- cosmos.so

Kind of a link saver. what would this category be called?

OUR MANIFESTO

In a time when every company has a bid on our data, when we exchange our privacy for information, when every move we make is influenced by how others will perceive it, we have little space to call our own.  

Our minds have been taken captive –

b y social approval systems, by newsfeeds and timelines, by advertisements and corporate agendas. Our information is scattered across platforms, bound by terms and conditions.  

What should have never been lost is now yours again. We promise:

- social features
- vanity metrics
- invasive tracking
- social pressure
- collaboration
- ads

We’re trying something different with mymind. It’s a refreshing approach to  
remembering the things you care about.  
One place for everything.

We put privacy first.

We love beautiful, simple design  
that considers and respects how you  
naturally think and work.

We’d rather you spend less time  
managing your life, and more time  
doing what makes you happy.
