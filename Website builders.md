## Existing comparisons (that are good)

This is a good site ... and a good example of doing comparison (there's this nifty questionnaire at the start that goes through a decision tree and gives recommendations). What it is missing again is pricing ...

## Squarespace

## Reddit threads

https://www.reddit.com/r/startup/comments/12rkrmm/what_website_builder_are_you_using_for_your/ (2023)

Main takeaways

- Don't use wordpress (unless you put time in) "Avoid Wordpress like the plague. A huge majority of WP sites I see as growth advisor are a SEO liability that will cost your company many dollars. ... If you do it right. For most customers their WP sites are SHIT. Like duplicate content, scripts and CSS not minified or combined, no meta-descriptions out of the box... it is so much wrong I don't even know where yo start. And no, I wouldn't use WIX, squarespace or webflow either. I would build some seriously fast SSR site with proper validated markup, and deferred loading of everything unnecessary."
- Wix is bad

### Another thread

https://www.reddit.com/r/webdesign/comments/1dmwtcj/wordpress_or_wixframer_website_builder/

here most people advocated webflow. interesting side comment about framer being limited

> Fix is owned by a zio, Framer is just a splash page drag and drop, Webflow lets you create everything you could dream of, and the hosting and all that shit is all on it, no need to separate all your stuff like on Wordpress like its 2009.

## Attempt to find a rigorous comparison e.g. someone taking a standard page and implementing it in 3 or 4 different tools

*Like people do with 'todolist' implementation in different web frameworks*

Tried this query in perplexity without much success https://www.perplexity.ai/search/looking-for-comparison-of-webs-Z0UvGGsKRPaq8z6UiS6vvA

> Looking for comparison of website builders like webflow, wordpress, wix, framer etc where someone built the same site in multiple tools

In google mostly content-spam or pitches of a product ...

## Why webflow  is good (vs ghost)

https://www.jacobmarciniec.com/blog/why-i-migrated-my-website-from-ghost-to-webflow-ghost-vs-webflow

> [!tip]
> This is what i want more of. Actually reasoned through explanation. why is the front page of google search almost always content spam now ...

Excerpts

>  A Ghost website is (no offense intended) just a blog. But I need much more from my website.
> 
> I need:
> 
> highly and quickly customizable static pages for a constantly evolving list of special projects I'm working on,
> highly and quickly customizable dynamic pages for a constantly evolving list of special projects I'm working on,
> an easy-to-manage, custom database that flawlessly integrates with my website,
> the capability to add an online store to my website (in the near future),
> a no-compromises HTML editor that allows me to do anything I want with the design of my website.
> ...and I need to be able to edit everything quickly, easily and effectively.
> 
> I thought the only way to get everything from the list above (short of paying a professional a lot of money) was to do it all by hand, by myself with the raw HTML, CSS, JS, dynamic templating code, Git, and my favorite web stack (Ubuntu, NodeJS, MongoDB, Nginx)...
> 
> ... until I found Webflow.

...

> Webflow allows you to do just about anything you could do by hand, faster. Webflow:
> 
> already has a powerful CMS built into it (that can be used for more than just blog posts),
> has a graphical interface (an extremely well-made and full-featured one) for quickly designing HTML and CSS,
> allows you to abide by DRY principles by reusing elements and only editing one instance to change all instances,
> Webflow basically allows you to visually build a website and database from scratch and make them dance together perfectly, without writing any code.

## Ghost thread

### Can you use ghost for non blogging / non-newsletter websites?

Maybe? Not really?

See this thread https://forum.ghost.org/t/using-the-ghost-platform-for-non-blogging-websites/38241

> For making some clientsâ€™ corporate websites, my biz partner always chooses WordPress and we slap some theme we get from themeforest but now Iâ€™m seriously considering using ghost.
>
> Question - Is ghost mainly meant for only blogging ? In WordPress, there is a section called Pages where we create pages of the website like home, about etc.
>
> Can we do the same using ghost ? Like - not using ghost as a blog platform but using it to create marketing / corporate websites etc ?

Answers

> You can absolutely do that. However, youâ€™ll have to do a lot of things on your own and that involves dabbling with HTML, CSS and Handlebar. Using WP with the new drag and drop Gutenberg is of course easier for customization.

> The text content can be easily edited even if it is on pages.
>
> However, if the pages have different design, then itâ€™s not straightforward.

## Webflow: Bit of a no-no if you are blogging

https://www.reddit.com/r/webflow/comments/vvi7bi/should_i_blog_with_webflow/ (2y old ðŸš©)

> wow these answers are so not accurate. DO NOT use webflow if blogging & content is a big part of what you're doing. it's literally the worst platform i have ever used for blogging. the simplest formatting changes are a nightmare to do and it just lacks the most basic functions. stay far away from webflow.

Another person

>  Don't listen to what people have told you here. Webflow is by far one of the worst blogging platforms ever created. It's slow, clunky with zero customizability. it looks like it was created in 1999. Stay far away from Webflow if you want a robust blogging platform.
