# Habit tracking apps

NB: I was looking for something super simple, and preferably free for just a few habits.

- Streaks (iphone) - no1 on iphone i think for habits. $5.99 one off
- Habituator ❌ subscription pricing.
- HabitKit. Free option.

### Habit Tracker

- 💰 0.

Tried this one and very decent. Up to five habits on free plan.

https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/habit-tracker/id1438388363

NB: actually has 4.7 rating from 4.8k ratings (on iphone) even thought shows much fewer on app store.
