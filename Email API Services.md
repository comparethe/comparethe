Options:

- Brevo (previously Sendinblue) - while it's OK, UX may not be great. 
- Sendgrid (part of Twilio) - been using it for a while and generally OK.
- Mailchimp - we used it for sometime but then switched to Brevo, general experience and **pricing** were the issues.
- Mailgun - we haven't tried
- Resend (backed by YC) https://resend.com/ - looks promising, esp, developer oriented â€“ use it for transactional emails.
- https://loops.so/ (also backed by YC) 
- Plunk - useplunk.com - not sure if other services support Markdown but it seems cool https://www.useplunk.com/blog/writing-emails-with-markdown
