# 🔍 Compare the ＿

## *Open, collaborative product comparison*

### *A simple, open product comparison wiki powered by Markdown, Github and [Flowershow](https://flowershow.app)*

Welcome 👋 to **CompareThe__ 🔍**

We provide **super-simple** product comparisons in an accessible, non-spammy way. We do this by collaborating to collect info from the web and organizing it in an open, accessible way. 

## Get started

## Motivation

- ☎️ Getting a new phone: every time i get a new phone i have to spend hours wading through reviews and spec trying to work out what phone is best fit and value for my needs. There are endless spammy product evaluations that don't really tell me much in the end. I can't find a single site that gives me the efficient frontier between price and quality (yes i know i could pay 1k plus for a top of the range samsung and apple or 200 bucks for something super low end. But what's the trade-off between price and quality. Do i really need 3 different cameras or ...
- 🚗 Recently i had to buy a new car (long story): i wanted to buy second-hand and preferably electric. it was a complete PITA to get a solid handle on even what models really fit my criteria. and i never succeeded in getting decent price comparison info for used cars. Can we do better?
- 💻 Searching the internet for a comparison of one framework to another (svelte vs react anyone) and being inundated by content-spammy sites that spend 3000 words repeating their docs only to conclude by saying "which one is better depends on your taste" (at which point you give up and go back to reading long threads on reddit)

Don't we remember when the internet was supposed to make product search better, quicker, easier ... 😉

## What this is ...

Principles and patterns for how we operate ...

- **📈 Facts and figures**: we have a preference for facts and figures over opions and reviews -- though reviews are helpful too. e.g. for cars we'd rather have info makes and models, used car prices, reliability ratings ... than in collecting reviews or opinions
- **☯ Simple**: try to present what we have with most relevant info first. Graphs are good etc ...
- **🎡 Fun**: it's not a business, it's helping each other and the world to find stuff better
- **🔬 Experimental**: let's try things out
- **🆕 A stub is better than nothing**: things don't have to perfect to get started ...

## What this is not ...

- We aren't trying to give reviews
- We aren't aiming to be comprehensive. If only end up comparing S3, R2 and Azure storage that's ok if the info is decent.
- We won't take link referral fees, recommender fees etc
- No AI generated spam content ...

## The approach

A collaborative approach **collecting product comparisons using simple, open markdown-based methods**.
