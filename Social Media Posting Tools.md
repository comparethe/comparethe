# What is the best tool for social media posting?

**Update: (2025-08-19) https://postiz.com/ is looking pretty good as an open source option. $29/mo**

**UPDATE: Canva (pro) is looking pretty good. $100/y**

## The need

You want a tool that ... 

- helps you author posts
  - 🎁 design posts - or at least easily add designs
- helps you post (schedule etc) on ...
  - LinkedIn
  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Instagram
  - YouTube
  - (WhatsApp?)
- 🎁 tracking and analytics (nice to have in one place) - but see also separate discussion in comparethe/comparethe#10 

### Some ideas

(First stab by @rufuspollock - changes welcome)

- Canva: need pro at ~$100/y 
- Typeshare - kind of a different model and more about writing stuff. $200/y

Also-rans

- https://later.com - rather instagram and influencer oriented. It is free though (for some stuff)
- https://Buffer.com: kinda of pricey especially once you add channels. $6/month / channel => $18/month for us w/ eg 3 channels
- https://mixpost.app - nice and open source but you have to self-host ...

## Comments from someone we asked (as of early 2024)

### Posting tools

- Canva: Pro version covers most stuff. Even the free version has enough features and templates, but with the pro subscription, you don't need any other tool for graphics and social media posts. It is very efficient and simple to use. 
- Typeshare: Never used it personally, but it is very similar to a Notion template I use to organize my freelance writing work. Could be beneficial for the team to organize ideas and future posts. 
- Later: The free features are quite limited and if you decide to use this tool, you will definitely need to pay for a subscription shortly down the line, and it's a bit pricey. 
- Buffer: The one attractive feature about this tool is that it tells you the ideal time to post content, which I don't feel is necessary at this stage for your accounts. This is more relevant for accounts with dozens of thousands of followers who actively compete against similarily big accounts to get pushed by the algorithm. Could be useful later, but like Later, it will require a paid subscription. 
- Buffer: All of its features could be obtained for free through Notion. 

### For analytics

- The Built-In Analytics: Every social media platform has its own built-in analytics tool. Using a paid external tool does save a lot of time, but if you want to cut down on costs, using the free features in these platforms provides the same amount of data, and you can keep track of it through Google Sheets or a Notion template.
- Cyfe: A social media tool designed towards tracking metrics and can include all platforms at once. Prices start at 19 dollars per month with a 14 days free trial.
- Sendible: "a social media management tool with considerable monitoring, listening, and reporting features. It gives you ready-to-use insights into social media post engagement, mentions, and audience profiles across digital channels. Sendible also lets you track what's being said about your brand on various web and social platforms and identifies mentions that might need your attention or response." This last feature can be very helpful to monitor online discussions about the organization and identify potential topics for future content. Prices start at 29 dollars per month. 
- Zoho Social: another tool for tracking social media metrics, but the unique feature it offers is displaying the forms of content your audience interacts with the most. Prices start at 10 dollars per month.
